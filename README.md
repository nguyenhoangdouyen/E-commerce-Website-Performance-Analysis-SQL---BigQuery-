## **üéØ V. How to Run the Queries** ##
1. Open Google BigQuery.
2. Load the dataset bigquery-public-data.google_analytics_sample.
3. Execute each query individually.

## **üéØ VI. How to Run the Queries** ##
This project highlights the application of SQL to analyze web traffic data in Google BigQuery. By writing queries, I explored key metrics such as visits, pageviews, bounce rates, transactions, and revenue per traffic source. These insights help understand user engagement and conversion trends. While SQL provides valuable data extraction and transformation capabilities, further visualization using tools like Power BI or Tableau would enhance the interpretation of these findings.
