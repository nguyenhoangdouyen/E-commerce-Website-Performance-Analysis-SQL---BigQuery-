# E-commerce Website Performance Analysis (SQL - BigQuery)  #
## **üéØ I. Introduction** ##
This project analyzes an E-commerce dataset using SQL in Google BigQuery, based on Google Analytics data. It focuses on extracting key business insights, including user behavior, revenue trends, bounce rates, cohort analysis, and purchase patterns. 
## **üéØ II. Requirements** ##
Based on stakeholder requirements, develop 08 BigQuery queries using the Google Analytics dataset to fulfill key responsibilities of a data analyst, ensuring the expected output aligns with business needs.
## **üéØ III. Dataset** ##
The eCommerce dataset is publicly available in Google BigQuery. Follow these steps to access it:

1. Log in to your **Google Cloud Platform** account and create a new project.
2. Open the **BigQuery Console** and select your project.
3. Click **"Add Data"** in the navigation panel, then choose **"Search a project"**.
4. In the search bar, enter the project ID: `bigquery-public-data.google_analytics_sample.ga_sessions` and press **Enter**.
5. Click on the `ga_sessions_` table to explore its structure and data.

## **üéØ V. How to Run the Queries** ##
1. Open Google BigQuery.
2. Load the dataset bigquery-public-data.google_analytics_sample.
3. Execute each query individually.

## **üéØ VI. How to Run the Queries** ##
This project highlights the application of SQL to analyze web traffic data in Google BigQuery. By writing queries, I explored key metrics such as visits, pageviews, bounce rates, transactions, and revenue per traffic source. These insights help understand user engagement and conversion trends. While SQL provides valuable data extraction and transformation capabilities, further visualization using tools like Power BI or Tableau would enhance the interpretation of these findings.
